I am a Graduate Research Assisstant at the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://www.abe.msstate.edu/), [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/). I work at the [Advanced Plant and Soil Sensing Lab](https://apsslab.abe.msstate.edu/).

My research involved enabling the use of [USDA-NSSC-KSSL Mid-infrared spectral library](https://soilspectroscopy.org/the-nssc-kssl-mir-spectral-library/) for USDA-NRCS field officers at Mississippi and Texas.

In 2016, I completed my bachelor's degree in Agricultural Technology and Management from the [Faculty of Agriculture](https://agri.pdn.ac.lk/), University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. I later earned my master's degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering from the [Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture](http://www.pgia.pdn.ac.lk/), University of Peradeniya.

I started my professional career in 2017, and since then I have worked with multiple private and government institutes at local and international levels.
