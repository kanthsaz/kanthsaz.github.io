I am a Graduate Research Assisstant at the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://www.abe.msstate.edu/), [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/). I work at the [Advanced Plant and Soil Sensing Lab](https://apsslab.abe.msstate.edu/).

My research involved enabling the use of [USDA-NSSC-KSSL Mid-infrared spectral library](https://soilspectroscopy.org/the-nssc-kssl-mir-spectral-library/) for USDA-NRCS field officers at Mississippi and Texas.
